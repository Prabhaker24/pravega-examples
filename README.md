# pravega-examples
Examples demonstrating Pravega features and configurations

## Preparing the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ravisharda/pravega-examples.git
$ cd pravega-examples
$ gradle wrapper
```

The code uses lombok to reduce boiler plate code. If you use an IDE you'll need to install a plugin to make the IDE understand it. See [their instructions](https://projectlombok.org/download.html) on how to do that.

## How to build

```
$ ./gradlew build
```
